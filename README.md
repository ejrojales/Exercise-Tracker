# CS 290 Web Development Portfolio-Project

Exercise Tracker is a full stack web application that allows users to track exercises by logging information  such as name of exercise, reps, weight, unit of weight, and date.

This project uses the MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. The project uses React for the front-end UI app. Implemented a REST API that supports CRUD operations using Node and Express for the back-end web service. Data is stored using MongoDB for persistence.
